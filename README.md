This GitHub was created as a future repository for my coding projects. As of right now, I've only taken one C++ course, and I don't have any projects to showcase.
That will change in the future. Consider this an "Under Construction" repo. Thank you for your patience.

In terms of my Portfolio Assignment, this is where I would have at least one coding project, I would have an overall description of the project,
explain what it is, why it's important to me, as well as list the technologies, languages, and libraries involved. I would list the known shortcomings
and bugs, as well as a list of improvements, modifications, and various iterations of the project.

And finally, I'd conclude with what I got out of the project. Unfortunately, as previously stated, I don't have any projects to call my own, as I've only taken
one C++ course at my current university. Said course don't have a final coding project, so I can't put that here either. However, before I graduate, I will have
one (or more) projects here, following the above format, to showcase my coding skills, style, and way of thinking.
